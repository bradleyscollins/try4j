- Updated copyright statement year to 2015.
- Added ThrowingPredicate.
- Changed Try#filter(Predicate) to Try#filter(ThrowingPredicate) so that it can
  accept predicates that may throw exceptions and modified Failure and Success
  implementations to match.
- Corrected signature of ThrowingFunction#apply(T) so that it includes a throws
  clause.
- Updated/added several tests so that they explicitly exercise the cases in
  which functions, predicates, and suppliers throw exceptions.
- Corrected some erroneous test names.
